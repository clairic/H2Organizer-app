# H2Organizer-app
Android app using an arduino uno combined with a HM10 bluetooth module and a ground humidity sensor. 
Getting the humidity from the ground and showing it through the app to the user, the whole project helps the user take care of the watering needs of a plant. 
To recreate the project you need an arduino Uno, a HM10 bluetooth module and a humidity sensor, as well as a breadboard and a few cables. 
Connect the arduino with the sensor etc as the .ino code shows. Download the app to your android phone by running the Java code.
The arduino will connect to your phone through the bluetooth and you will be able to monitor the watering needs of the plant. 
The whole project was a university project that I had a lot of fun working on. :)
